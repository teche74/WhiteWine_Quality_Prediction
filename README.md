# WhiteWine_Quality_Prediction_LinearRegression

This project is a simple analysis of the White Wine dataset, exploring the relationships between different features and the quality of wine. A linear regression model was built to understand how linear modeling works in R.

# Getting Started
To reproduce this analysis, you will need to have R and RStudio installed on your computer. Clone the repository to your local machine and open the project in RStudio.


# Prerequisites
To run the analysis, you will need to install the following packages: ggplot2, dplyr, caret, glmnet, and tidyverse.

# Data
The White Wine dataset used in this analysis is available in the UCI Machine Learning Repository and can be found at the following URL: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality.

# Analysis
The analysis script can be found in the "White_Wine_Quality_Prediction.R" file. The script loads the data, explores it with summary statistics and visualizations, performs a train-test split, fits a linear regression model, and evaluates the model's performance with metrics such as RMSE and R-squared.

# Results
The final linear regression model had an RMSE of 0.719 and an R-squared value of 0.285.
